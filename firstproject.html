		<p class="review-text">I will admit that as a stereotypical pianist I tend to gravitate towards romanticism. But this piece is a gem! Mozart slaaayyed with this movement. If I was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Salieri#Interaction_with_Mozart"> Salieri</a> this would play in my nightmare's. In my opinion this movement is often played a bit too fast. It feels like there is no time to soak in the beauty of every note. Helene Grimaud has the most amazing soul and milks every moment perfectly. Hope it moves you as much as it moves me. </p>

		<p class="review-text">It is undisputable that Anna Netrebko is one of the leading sopranos from the last decades. In this video young Anna, conducted by Maestro Valery Gergiev, sings Gliere's Concerto for Coloratura Soprano. If you have heard her voice in more recent videos you probably are used to a darker, rounder, more mature sound. I love her now as well, but this video will remain as my favorite of hers. There is a certain mermaid-like quality to her voice that reminds me of young soprano Nadine Sierra. Who is also one of my favorites! Lets all thank Gliere for composing this glorious work for humanity...... Amen. </P>
